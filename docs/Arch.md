# Arch Linux
"btw i use..."

[Official Site](https://archlinux.org/)

[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
    + Legendary wiki; useful as a bookmark even on non Arch-based distros

"Rolling Release" Linux distribution. 
    - Constant stream of software updates as opposed to a few major updates across a 
      year.

[Pacman](docs/Pacman.md) -- packagage manager

AUR -- Arch User Repository
    - User-maintained repos for most things not found in the official Arch repos.
    - [Paru](docs/Paru.md) -- "AUR helper"; similar to Yay

* Advantages/Disadvantages:
    * "Bleeding Edge" --
        + always up-to-date; latest software
        - instability; things ***can*** break across updates
    * Minimal Install --
        + "Bottom Up" approach to building a system
        + No Bloat
        - CLI installer/lack of official GUI installer[^1]
        - Finding/Installing needed dependancies sometimes difficult



[^1]: This might be wrong actually, 2021-05-06, there might be an official GUI installer now. Fix this later.
