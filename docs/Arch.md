# Arch Linux
[Official Site](https://archlinux.org/)

"Rolling Release" Linux distribution
- Constant stream of software updates as opposed to a few major updates across a year.

[Pacman](Pacman.md) -- packagage manager; similar to [APT](APT.md) for [Debian](Debian.md) 

ie: full system upgrade
```
sudo pacman -Syu
```

[Paru](Paru.md) -- 'AUR helper'; similar to Yay
>AUR -- Arch User Repository
>
>User-maintained repos for most things not found in the official Arch repos.

## Advantages/Disadvantages over a Stable Release:
* "Bleeding Edge":
    + always up-to-date; latest software
    - instability; constant upgrades means things ***can*** break across updates
* Minimal Install:
    + "Bottom Up" approach to building a system; No bloat
    - Command line installer; no established GUI installer
