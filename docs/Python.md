```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

def hello_world():
    print('This is Python')
```

Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that excels in:
* Data Science
* Machine Learning/AI
* Automation/Scripting
* and more...

It is an *interpreted* language, as opposed to a *compiled* language

There is a **very** important distinction between Python 2.x.x and Python 3.x.x
- `Python3` is the most recent version
- Python 2.x.x is no longer under development and will be discontinued eventually

**Easy to Learn**:
* simple syntax -- basically *pseudocode*
* wide-spread support -- extensive standard library/external resources
* Python interpreter allows for quick testing, no compiling wait time
