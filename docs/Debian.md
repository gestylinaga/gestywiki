# Debian

[Official Site](https://www.debian.org/)

Stable Release Linux distribution
- A few major updates spread out across the year, as opposed a constant stream of updates.

[Apt](APT.md) -- package manager; similar to [Pacman](Pacman.md) for [Arch](Arch.md)

ie: full system upgrade
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Advantages/Disadvantages:
* "Stable Release"
    + 'stable' means reliable; things are just gonna work
    - Official Repo's don't always have latest software; can always compile things manually
* EZ PZ Install
    + Hassle-free GUI installer; click 'next' until you're done
    - Uneeded software; takes time to debloat everything you don't need
