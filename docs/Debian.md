# Debian

[Official Site](https://www.debian.org/)

Stable Release Linux distribution
- A few major updates across the year, as opposed a constant stream of updates.

[Apt](Apt.md) -- package manager; similar to Pacman for Arch

ie: full upgrade
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Advantages/Disadvantages:
* "Stable Release"
    + Official Repository is 'stable'; things are just gonna work
    - Missing some of the latest software; can still be compiled manually
* EZPZ Install
    + Hassle-free GUI installer; click 'next' until you're done
    - Uneeded software; takes time to debloat everything you don't need
