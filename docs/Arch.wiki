      year.

* Advantages:
    * "Bleeding Edge" --
        - Being on the forefront of innovation can come with a cost...instability.
    * Minimal Install --
        - Starting with a nearly empty slate, or bare-minimum install, lets you approach
          building a system from the ground-up. No bloat.
    * Customization Control
